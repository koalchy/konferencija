Enter the W3C Payment Request API, a standardized API to build simpler checkout experiences powered by a native front-end, provided by the browser. In this talk, you’ll see how to use the Payment Request API to create seamless payment flows for users across platforms, resulting in a better user experience built to simplify checkout and improve shopping cart conversion.",

        "title": "Where The Web Is Going",
        "description": "The web is a strange place with many standards and browser vendors that all have to come together to make something useful. This talk looks at what’s next for web technologies including ECMAScript 2016, Service Workers, the Fetch API, and HTTP/2. It then looks at how these standards come about and which groups set the direction. We’ll discuss how the W3C, WHATWG, ECMA TC39, and IETF work together (or don’t) to push the Web forward. You’ll leave this talk better prepared for the web of tomorrow.",

        "description": "I always found the mobile world intimidating.  The two platforms in particular, with their own languages and rapidly changing apis, were a barrier to trying anything out.  Once Ionic 2 went into Beta, I managed to get a project off the ground, but I found working inside a web-view was often really limiting, and the slowness of the UI had a negative impact on my users.",
